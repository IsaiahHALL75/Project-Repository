## Project Overview
In this project, our group designed and developed a comprehensive cybersecurity system for a government organization. We applied concepts and techniques such as: use case diagrams, mapping UML, python automation, data analysis, and risk management. Throughout the development of our cybersecurity system, it was challenging to implement the system's incident response and were faced with missed functionality within the code. Our objectives were to apply system engineering concepts such as automation and data analytics to design the cybersecurity system, utilize UML to model the system processes, implement python automation scripts for various cybersecurity tasks, integrate data analytics for threat detection/response, and finally to develop risk management plans. These concepts are significant in cybersecurity because they are used in order to ensure the security and strength of a cybersecurity system.
