# Project Results

In conclusion, this project provided our group with a hands-on experience designing and developing a cybersecurity system for a government organization. By applying system engineering concepts such as UML modeling, python automation, data analysis, and risk management, we were able to create a system capable of monitoring and responding to security threats. Our use of tools like Pands, psutil, nmap, and scapy allowed us to automate crucial tasks, including: performance monitoring, log file analysis, and network scanning. Despite the challenges we faced such as syntax error, high CPU usage, and open ports for unauthorized access, we overcame these obstacles through developing the code.
